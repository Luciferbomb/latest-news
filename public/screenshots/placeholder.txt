For PWA Builder, you'll need to replace these placeholder files with actual screenshots of your app:

1. screenshot1.png (1280x720) - Desktop view of the home screen
2. screenshot2.png (1280x720) - Desktop view of the news feed
3. screenshot-mobile1.png (750x1334) - Mobile view of the app

These screenshots are important for app stores when you package your PWA for iOS and Android.
